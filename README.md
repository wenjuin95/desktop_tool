Last year, I create an app to help me easily track my website by click. (https://github.com/wenjuin95/lazy_program)
After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I discovered a framework called Electron, which allows to build apps with those langguage. 
So, I started using them to create my app. Now i'm not only able to track my website, i also able to track my app and folder.
